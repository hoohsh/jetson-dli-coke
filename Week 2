# NVIDIA Jetson Activities

## 1. Using jtop
### What is jtop?
`jtop` is a powerful tool for monitoring the system status of NVIDIA Jetson devices in real time. Jetson Nano and similar devices provide the following information:
- **Temperature**: Displays the temperature of components such as the CPU, GPU, and PMIC (Power Management IC).
- **Resource Usage**: Monitors CPU and GPU usage, memory and swap usage, and power consumption.
- **Process Management**: Lists running processes and their resource usage.
- **Device Information**: Displays hardware and software details, including the JetPack version.

### Checking Temperature with jtop
To monitor the system temperature, run the following command in the terminal:
```bash
jtop


## 2. Installing a Cooling Fan

### Why Install a Cooling Fan?
The Jetson Nano may experience performance degradation or system instability due to high temperatures. Installing a cooling fan helps to manage the device's temperature effectively.

### Installation Steps

2-1. **Connect the Fan:**
   - Attach the fan's red (+), black (-), and yellow (PWM) wires to the Jetson Nano pin headers.
   - Pin configuration:
     - **5V** (+)
     - **GND** (-)
     - **PWM**

2-2. **Secure the Fan:**
   - Place the fan on top of the Nano's heatsink and secure it with screws.

2-3. **Adjust Fan Speed:**
   Run the following command to control the fan's speed:
   ```bash
   sudo sh -c 'echo 128 > /sys/devices/pwm-fan/target_pwm'
Check Temperature: Use the jtop command to verify that the temperature has dropped.
bash
jtop
